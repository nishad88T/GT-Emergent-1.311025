<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully migrated a complex grocery tracking application from the Base44 platform to an Emergent-hosted FastAPI backend and React frontend. The process involved extensive backend development to recreate existing functionalities like OCR processing, LLM canonicalization, and nutrition lookups, using placeholders initially and later integrating real AWS Textract, CalorieNinjas, and OpenAI services. Frontend migration involved cloning a GitHub repository, replacing Base44 SDK calls with a new , and debugging numerous React/Vite-related issues, including environment variable handling ( to ), duplicate imports, missing component exports, and routing complexities. The development was iterative, tackling blank screen issues by simplifying the frontend and progressively reintroducing features. The latest challenge is a blank screen after adding all features, alongside a user request to switch LLM to GPT-4 mini for cost efficiency.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested assistance in migrating a grocery spending tracker app, with the backend existing as a Word document and the frontend to be linked via GitHub. The core functionality includes user receipt uploads, OCR extraction (using AWS Textract), LLM processing for canonicalizing items (OpenAI GPT-4), and providing insights/analysis. The user is concerned about cost, privacy of backend code, and aims for mobile app store deployment (Apple/Google Play). Key integrations required are AWS Textract, CalorieNinjas API for nutrition lookups, and an email service (Brevo). The app is currently functional on Base44 but needs to be recreated on Emergent. The user also explicitly requested switching the LLM to GPT-4 mini for cost efficiency.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:

    -   : Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB schema. Created to structure application data (e.g., Household, Receipt, Item).
    -   : Contains business logic and external service integrations (AWS Textract, CalorieNinjas, OpenAI). Created to encapsulate core processing logic.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Blank Screen Issue:** The frontend is currently showing a blank screen after the last set of feature additions.
-   **LLM Model Switch:** Implement the user's request to switch the default LLM model from GPT-4 to GPT-4 mini for cost efficiency.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was attempting to implement all missing features and pages from the user's original Base44 app and fix the OpenAI JSON parsing issue. The backend was updated to use a refined GPT-4 prompt to ensure valid JSON output. The frontend was extensively modified to add numerous new pages and navigation items, including , , , , and .

However, this last set of changes resulted in the frontend ( and related files) again presenting a blank (white) screen on the preview URL, indicating new JavaScript errors after adding the comprehensive set of components and routing. The previous approach of adding all components at once likely introduced new import or rendering issues.

The user also explicitly requested switching the LLM model from  to  in the backend for cost-effectiveness. The AI engineer acknowledged this, stating they would fix the blank screen first by reverting to a simpler working frontend, and then switch to GPT-4 mini. The last action was to revert to a simpler working frontend version by editing  and then restarting both frontend and backend.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to fix the current blank screen issue by reverting to a simpler, known-working frontend version and then progressively re-adding components and features, while also switching the LLM to GPT-4 mini.
